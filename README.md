# Home Automation System with PICSimLab and Blynk

This project implements an IoT-based home automation system using PICSimLab simulation and Blynk IoT mobile app. It manages garden lights, temperature monitoring, and water inflow/outflow in a tank.

## Features

- **Garden Lights Control:** Control brightness based on ambient light using LDR.
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Monitor and display temperature in real-time.
- **Water Management:** Control water inflow and outflow in a tank based on predefined levels.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno, sensors (LDR, temperature sensor), simulation software (PICSimLab).
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Blynk IoT mobile app.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Arduino sketch in Arduino IDE.
3. Install necessary libraries (if any).
4. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno board.
5. Set up the Blynk app according to provided instructions.

## Usage

1. Connect the Arduino Uno board to the PICSimLab simulation.
2. Launch the Blynk app and connect it to the configured project.
3. Use the app to control garden lights, monitor temperature, and manage the water tank.
